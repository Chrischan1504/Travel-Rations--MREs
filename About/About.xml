		Ready-to-eat meals, both simple and fine, specially cooked and packaged to travel well and last a long time. Intended for caravans, but probably useful for panic rooms and winter, too.

		Features:

		* Takes 2x as long to cook/prepare as their analogous meal;
		* Can cook 1x or 5x MREs simultaneously;
		* MREs are slightly less nutritious than their analogous meal;
		* MREs weigh half as much as their analogous meal;
		* MREs also take up less space than their analogous meals, so they stack to 25;
		* MREs are not fabulous, so colonists are slightly unhappy to eat them. (Mood -1 for fine, -2 for simple: better than eating raw or disgusting food, but it's not like home cooking.)
		* MREs last 80 days (like pemmican) before they start rotting. Rot doesn't destroy them, so your caravan has the option to eat rotting MREs to survive at the tail end of their journey. Mmmmmmm!
